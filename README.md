## 🤔 My process

### 🛠️ Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Vite](https://vite.dev/) - Build Tool for the Web
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) - Node.js framework

### 👨‍🏫 What I learned

This project is a bit different not just from the visual aspect side , that challenged me to use CSS grid and code responsive designes way faster, but I built my first proxy server , in [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) , in order to fetch the shortened URL coming from using [Cleanuri](https://cleanuri.com). This really expanded my knowledge of web security especally Cross-Origin-Resource-Sharing(CORS) errors. I now know what they are and how to resolve this issues going forward as a frontend developer. Thanks 😃 [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io) for expanding my knowledge with this project.

### 🏃‍♂️ Continued development

Areas that I want to focus more on are

- API integration
- Application Deployment (CI/CD pipleine)
- Usage of svg image files

### 📚 Useful resources

- [ChatGPT](https://chatgpt.com) - This AI helped me build my proxy server for my app
